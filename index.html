            <br><center><b>QWhich masks are the best?</b><br>
            Some studies have shown that an N95 mask offers at least five times greater protection than a surgical mask.
            <br><br><b>QWhat exactly is a new variant?</b><br>
            Viruses constantly change through mutation. When a virus has one or more new mutations itâ€™s called a variant of the original virus. Currently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified two variants of the virus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as variants of concern.
            Delta and omicron
            <br><br><b>QHow does covid spread?</b><br>
            People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person
